# notesApp
 My website is a simple and efficient platform built using React, Next.js, Express, and Node.js. It enables users to quickly and conveniently add, edit, delete, and archive notes. With MongoDB as the backend database, the application offers a seamless experience while filtering notes between archived and non-archived ones, making organization and access to information intuitive.
